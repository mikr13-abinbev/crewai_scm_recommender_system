  - Healthy revenue contributor with $50,000 earning potential. Moderate stock increases will benefit sales continuity.
  - *Financial Impact*: Incremental stock additions help avoid stock shortages during peak demand periods.

### SKU3
- **Current Stock vs. Recommended Levels**: Current stock is 70. Recommended level is 60.
- **Specific Action**: Maintain stock.
- **Recommended Order Quantity**: None.
- **Business Rationale and Financial Impact**:
  - Current stock sufficient given moderate revenue generation. Focus on monitoring sales trends.
  - *Financial Impact*: No immediate risk of stockouts; hence no immediate financial impact.

### SKU4
- **Current Stock vs. Recommended Levels**: Current stock is 100. Recommended level is 90.
- **Specific Action**: Decrease stock.
- **Recommended Order Quantity**: None.
- **Business Rationale and Financial Impact**:
  - High stock levels relative to revenue contribution. It's prudent to optimize inventory levels.
  - *Financial Impact*: Reduce holding costs for lower-priority SKUs, enhancing cash flow.

## 2. INVENTORY OPTIMIZATION INSIGHTS

### Overstocked Items (Holding Cost Risk)
- SKU4: High current stock suggests potential for reduced holding costs by decreasing levels to align better with demand.

### Understocked Items (Stockout Risk)
- SKU2: Immediate stock level increases are necessary to prevent stockouts and revenue loss.

### Slow-moving Inventory Recommendations
- SKU4: Evaluate demand pattern changes; explore promotion strategies to enhance sale-through.

## 3. SUPPLY CHAIN RISKS

### Long Lead Time Products Requiring Buffer Stock
- SKU2 leads with high lead times; buffer stock recommendation to manage potential delays.

### High Defect Rate Products Needing Supplier Review
- No specific SKU noted; continuous monitoring required for quality assurance and supplier performance reviews.

### Seasonal Considerations
- Assess seasonal demand variations across all SKUs, adjusting stock levels preemptively to accommodate potential shifts in customer demand.

## 4. FINANCIAL IMPACT SUMMARY

### Estimated Cost Savings from Optimization
- Reducing stock levels for low-priority SKUs like SKU4 expected to significantly cut down on excess holding costs.

### Revenue Protection from Stockout Prevention
- Maintaining SKU1 and increasing SKU2 stocks are preventive measures to safeguard significant revenue streams from stockout losses.

### Working Capital Recommendations
- Improved stock level alignment will free working capital, allowing reinvestment into high-priority products with robust demand profiles.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to proactively manage inventory levels, enhance revenue assurance, and optimize financial resources, driving strategically aligned business outcomes.
